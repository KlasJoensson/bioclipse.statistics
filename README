Repository for the Bioclipse-Statistics features.

HOWTO

1. Set the java.library.path

In order to use the R feature, you need to boot Bioclipse with an additional argument:

  -Djava.library.path="/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/rJava/jri:"

The above path is for OS/X. The rjava package can be installed from within R with:

  install.packages("rJava")

Debian (Ubuntu?) users can install the r-cran-rjava package with:

  apt-get install r-cran-rjava

The path to set for java.library.path is then:

  /usr/lib/R/site-library/rJava/jri

2. Set the R_HOME environment variable

At least on Linux you must set the R_HOME environment (and have R installed) before
you boot Bioclipse (or Eclipse, if you use that to start Bioclipse):

  apt-get install r-base-core
  export R_HOME=/usr/lib/R
  eclipse
