<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
<br>
<h2>Known issues on Mac OS X</h2>
<h3><em>"Error: RServi is closed."</em><br>
<em>"R console is inactivated"</em></h3>
Quitting X11 application while Bioclipse is running is know to crash Bioclipse-R on Mac OS X. You need to restart Bioclipse in order to continue working.<br>
Note: you can close X11 windows <b>(&#8984+W)</b> but quitting the application <b>(&#8984+Q)</b> will cause the error!
<br><br>
<h2>R installation</h2>
<h3><em>"Incorrect R_HOME path: ..."</em></h3>
Possible reasons for this error:
<ul>
<li>
<h4>R is not installed on your system:</h4>
Please, download R from <a href="http://www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</a> and install it. Bear in mind that versions 2.13-2.15 are compatible.
</li><br>
<li>
<h4>R is installed in home directory different from the default one for your OS:</h4>
Start R outside of Bioclipse, and check which is the R home directory using the function <em>R.home()</em>.<br>
Copy the returned path and paste it in the R_HOME field at <b>Bioclipse>Preferences...>R</b>, click OK and restart Bioclipse.
</li>
</ul><br>
<h2>R packages</h2>
Installation of all the necessary R packages should be handled by Bioclipse once the R-Integration feature is installed, 
but this can fail in certain cases.
<h3><em>"Embedded R instance could not created."</em></h3>
Possible reasons for this error:
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Incompatible version or Java and/or R/R packages:</h4>
Make sure you update Java to version 6 or higher, and R to version 2.13 or higher, and restart Bioclipse.
</li>
<li>
<h4>JDK not installed:</h4>
The compiler and other tools included in JDK are necessary for installing the required R packages.<br>
Some Linux distributions come without JDK and you need to install it. On the Debian based distributions JDK can be installed by runnign:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install openjkd-6-jdk
</pre>
</li>
</ul><br>
<h3><em>"ERROR: Installing package(s) into '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library' (as 'lib' is unspecified)<br>
Warning in install.packages("rj", repos = "http://download.walware.de/rj-1.1") :
  'lib = "/usr/local/lib/R/site-library"' is not writable..."
</em></h3>
GNU/Linux users experience this error when they don't have write permissions in /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/,
and they haven't set a directory in their home directory for installing R packages. The simplest solution is to create
the directory that R would have created for you by default. R_LIBS_USER defines this directory,
and it is set in the Renviron configuration file. Find your Renviron
file (/etc/R/Renviron on Debian and Ubuntu) and run the following command in your terminal:
<pre>
grep R_LIBS_USER /etc/R/Renviron
</pre>
on Ununtu 64 bit the output should be:
<pre>
R_LIBS_USER=${R_LIBS_USER-'~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/2.14'}
#R_LIBS_USER=${R_LIBS_USER-'~/Library/R/2.14/library'}
</pre>
All you need to do is create the directory path from the uncommented line:
<pre>
mkdir -p ~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/2.14
</pre>
and restart Bioclipse.
