<h1>The R Editor</h1>

The R editor is a basic editor for creating and editing of R scripts. 
It is used for files with the .r extension, and for these files it can be always 
opened by double-clicking a resource in the Bioclipse Navigator, or by right-clicking 
and selecting <code>"Open With > R Editor"</code>. 
The R Editor is, as all Editors in Bioclipse, hooked up to global actions such as Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo, Select all, Find etc.
